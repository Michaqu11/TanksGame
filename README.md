Heuristic: 
1) Follow - the player following opponent
2) Getaway - the player runs away from the opponent
3) Rand - the player moves in a random direction, but keeps the direction if it can
4) Dodge - the player dodges when a projectile approaches him
5) Shot - the player shoots when the opponent is within range of the shot
